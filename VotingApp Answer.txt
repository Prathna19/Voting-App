#Deleting a votePod in Kubernetes


8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

"☝️ Delete them in same order 
1st ► VOTE pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
2nd ► WORKER pod  ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
3rd ► DB pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix"


1st:VOTE pod ►


kubectl get pods
then selecte pod and then delete it

kubectl delete pod vote-7d884dd585-hgssr

After Deleting the Voting Pod: The voting app stops accepting votes, and users see errors in the UI.

The voting interface will likely show an error message when trying to submit a vote, such as "Service unavailable" or "Cannot connect to the server."
Users will not be able to cast votes.

#output:

Pod Status: The database pod will show as "Terminating" and will eventually be removed from the list of active pods when you check:



2nd:-WORKER pod

kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod worker-6fc5d5b668-khv96
pod "worker-6fc5d5b668-khv96" deleted

After Deleting the Worker Pod: The results page remains static with stale data and cannot process new votes.

The results page may continue to display the last known results, but it will not update with new votes.
If users try to refresh the results page, they may see stale data or an error indicating that the worker service is unavailable.

Pod Status: The database pod will show as "Terminating" and will eventually be removed from the list of active pods when you check:



3rd:-DB pod
and
10. what happens after db pod deletion?


kubectl delete pod db-58cc845644-gxn8n
pod "db-58cc845644-gxn8n" deleted


Both applications will become non-functional, showing errors about database connectivity.
Users trying to submit votes will encounter errors, and the results page will fail to load any data, possibly displaying a "Database unavailable" message.

After Deleting the Database Pod: Both applications become non-functional, with errors indicating inability to connect to the database.

Pod Status: The database pod will show as "Terminating" and will eventually be removed from the list of active pods when you check:


11. complete the assignment by making the result pod work. (if it is not working)

AnsWer:-

root@ip-172-31-33-69:~/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications# kubectl get pods

Redeployment:

Successfully redeployed pods using kubectl apply -f ..



Voting App:

Vote Submission Fails: Users attempting to submit votes will receive error messages, such as "Unable to connect to the database" or "Service unavailable."
No New Votes Processed: The application cannot record or process any new votes, rendering the voting functionality inoperative.
Results App:

Stale Results: The results page may continue to display the last known vote counts but will not update as no new data can be retrieved.
Error Messages: Refreshing the results page will likely produce errors indicating a failure to connect to the database.
System Behavior

Pod Status: The database pod will show as "Terminating" and will eventually be removed from the list of active pods when you check:

In summary, deleting the database pod disrupts both the voting and results functionalities, causing application failures and preventing any new data from being processed or retrieved.
